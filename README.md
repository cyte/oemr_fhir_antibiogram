This is a simple FHIR app to demonstrate 1 of our 2 ONC use cases - antibiogram.
The input for this app is two seperate json files curated from the ONC antibiogram workshop.
These two files (male.json/female.json) will need to be provided prior to use.
Additionally, the client/secret pair from your EMR is necessary for launch.html prior to running.

We have placed this app within OpenEMR v6.0.0 for our demonstrations.
